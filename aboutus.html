                        <p>Hi, I'm Tressa, and this is Shoobydua. I'm a certified AKC breeder, and this beautiful boy is our sire and an Official Certified Pet Therapy Dog. We established Three River Retrievers in 2022 and we are a professional breeder of Golden Retrievers. Our goal is to sire healthy, happy pups and find them loving families. <br><br> I personally take time off whenever a litter is close to being born, and stay with the mother during the entire process. The safety of the pups and mother is very important to me and I do everything I can to ensure they're healthy. <br><br>All of our pups are given regular veterinary checkups and care. You can come meet them! Head over to the <a href="contact.html">contact us page</a> to find out how!</p>
